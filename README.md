# Data-Wrangling
In this Wrangling project I will be discussing my efforts in Gathering, Assessing, Cleaning, Analyzing, and Visualizing Data of WeRateDogs Twitter account.<br>
<br> The repository consists of 3 files: <br>
1- wrangle_act (where the code is) <br>
2- wrangle_report (Where I will be discussing my wrangling efforts) <br>
3- act_report (Where I will be communicating the insights and display the visualizations produced from my wrangled data )
